# PPTC CD276

**Prepare Figures 1, 2, and 3A with the ./scripts/main_pptc_cd276.R script.**
- Note: due to the size of the Treehouse and GTEx datasets, only TPM for CD276 is provided in the ./data directory

**To prepare expression matrices:**
-  Treehouse+GTEx: follow treeGTEx_RNAseq.R and treeGTEx_qsub.R (qsub requires >64GB RAM)
-  PPTC PDXs: follow pptc_RNAseq.R
